    <p>Best Cheesecake you'll have</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)
        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)
        </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (85g) butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (133g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.        </li>
        <li>To bake the cheesecake: Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.  </li>
    </ol>
